# Microdrive development

The objective is to build a microdrive. We are starting with neuropixels 1.0, which are very large for mice.

1. Allows recovery of the probe after the experiment.
2. The probe is solidely held in place.

For the first experiments, we will not use a microdrive system. Matteo Carandini thinks it is not necessary.

## Parts

1. Probe plate: hold the microdrive
2. Probe plate casing: is cemented to the skull skull and base. The probe plate is screwed to this before implantation
3. Base: attached to the skull. Provide anchor to skull. The connector plate is screwed into the base.
4. Connector plate: Hold the headstage and connector to plug the animal.
5. Lid: covers all the material, only the connector is exposed.


## Probe plate

A plate on which we glue the probe. 
It needs 2 nuts near the top for recovery and to hold the probe when implanting.
It needs 3 screw holes to attach the probe plate to the casing.
We could use M1.2 screws and nuts for extra strength.


## Probe plate casing

Cemented to the skull and base when implanting.
It needs to provide a very solid and stable platform for the probe plate.

## Base

We will enlarge the base we use for neuronexus probe. It will need to be longer and larger.

## Connector plate

This holds the pcb with the connector and is screwed to the back of the base.

## Lid

Light-weight structure protecting the probe and the rest of the material on the head.
